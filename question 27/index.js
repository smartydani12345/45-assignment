//• If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
//• If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
//• If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
//• If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
//• If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
