// Q45) Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


interface Car {

    manufacturer:string,
    model:string,
    [key:string]:any

}

function carInfo(manufacturer:string,model:string,...extras:[string,any][]):Car{

const car:Car={manufacturer,model}
extras.forEach(([key,value])=>{

    car[key]=value;
})


return car


}


const car=carInfo("Nissan","GTR4",["color","black"],["year",2024])


console.log(car)
